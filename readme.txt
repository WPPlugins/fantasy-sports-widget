Send request to kurt@fantasyknuckleheads.com. Only established websites with quality fantasy sports content are considered for inclusion to this fantasy sports network. Only those webmasters which run this widget on their website will have their content displayed on the widget. If you remove the widget from your website your website will be pragmatically removed from the network. Basically, if you run the widget on your website then your website will be included in the network syndication and if you ever remove the widget you?ll be removed from the network.
